# 🧩 Advanced Programming in C – Coursework Archive

Welcome to my personal archive for the *Advanced Programming in C* course. This repository includes all homework, class exercises, and additional code experiments developed as part of the course.

This course expanded on foundational C knowledge and focused on more complex programming techniques, system-level features, and efficient memory usage.
